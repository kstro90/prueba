This git contains the work done by students of the Master in 
Telematics Engineering at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (www.uc3m.es). 
The goal of this team of students was to develop a learning analytics extension 
and a dummy data generator for Google Course Builder. The team was composed 
of the following students: Roderick Fanou, Miriam Marciel, Foivos Michelinakis 
and Omar Aly. The professor supervising has been Pedro Mu√±oz Merino. The 
interaction with Sean Lip and Pavel Simakov of the Google GCB team is gratefully 
appreciated (Google has no responsibility for the developed code). 
You may find all the contributions at the changes.txt file.
Please note that this work is based on Google Course Builder version 1.3.1, 
Google App Engine version 1.7.5 and Python 2.7.3.
